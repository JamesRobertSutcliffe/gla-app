export const skillTimeText = "I started my programming journey by completing HTML, CSS and javascript courses on websites such as FreeCodeCamp and codeacademy during 2021. This was a slow process and it felt like I was not making much progress at first. During 2022 I began to build simple web applications but I felt my skillset was still limited. In 2023 I saw a real jump in my knowledge by completing the trilogy skills web development bootcamp in Q1 and Founders and Coders Software Foundation in Q4. This experience allowed me to develop my knowledge of Git, reactive frameworks, AI, debugging and more complex programming methods creating an overall more rounded skillset.  "

export const skillsText = "My coding skills are mainly focused around web development frameworks. I have a solid grasp of frontend development in HTML, CSS and Javascript as well as skills in backend development in Node.js. I also have experience developing projects in reactive JS frameworks including React, Next.js and Svelte. On top of this, I have begun developing full stack application via the integration of SQL databases. Recently I have attended C# coding workshops. Examples of projects I have built using the mentioned frameworks are availabel at the bottom of this webpage."
